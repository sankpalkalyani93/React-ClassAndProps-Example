Explanation
Parent Component (App):
  1. The App component is a functional component that uses the useState hook to manage the state of the input numbers (num1 and num2) and the result (sum).
  2. It defines event handlers (handleNum1Change and handleNum2Change) to update the state when the user inputs values.
  3. The calculateSum function computes the sum of num1 and num2 and updates the sum state.
  4. The component renders two input fields, a button to trigger the summation, and the SumDisplay child component, passing the sum as a prop.

Child Component (SumDisplay):
  1. The SumDisplay component is a functional component that accepts props as an argument and displays the sum received from the parent component.
